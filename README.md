# 🧠 React Practice Dev Solutions

This repository contains my personal solutions to the problems from [reactpractice.dev](https://reactpractice.dev/) — a hands-on site to improve your React skills through real-world challenges.

## 🧩 About the Problems

Each problem is designed to sharpen your knowledge in:

- React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useReducer`, etc.)
- Component composition
- State management
- Performance optimizations
- UX patterns and accessibility

## 📁 Structure

Each problem is placed in its own folder with the following format:

```
/pages
  └── *.tsx
/pages
  └── *.tsx
...
```

You can run each individually or explore them all.

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bharath-Kumar-S/react-practice-dev.git
cd react-practice-dev
npm install
npm run dev
```
